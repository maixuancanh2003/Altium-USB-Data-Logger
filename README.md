## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To start using the **USB Data Logger**:
1. Connect the board to a USB power source and set up the desired USB mode (host or device).
2. Program the ESP32-S3 with firmware tailored for your data logging requirements (e.g., logging environmental data, diagnostics).
3. Attach a compatible USB device or sensor for data input in host mode, or connect it to a host for data retrieval in device mode.
4. Configure storage options, either using onboard flash or an external microSD card, to store the logged data.
5. Begin logging data, and access stored data periodically for analysis.

## ðŸ›  Usage Examples
1. **Environmental Data Logging**: Capture data from USB sensors for temperature, humidity, or other environmental variables and store it on a microSD card.
2. **Device Diagnostics**: Use the USB Data Logger in host mode to log diagnostic data from USB-connected devices for troubleshooting or maintenance purposes.
3. **Portable Data Collection**: Operate in low power mode for portable applications where continuous data logging is needed in the field.
